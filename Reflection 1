I am excited to learn about coding. I did some coding in high school but forgot all about it. I am excited to see how I can use coding for my creative practices.
I am happy we got to read Professor Santos’ story about her first time being introduced to coding because it makes me feel more confident about asking questions. 
I was a little nervous at first because I often feel like I don’t belong in certain places. 
After reading her story, I feel brave to not know and brave to ask questions.
