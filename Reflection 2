I was confused about giving certain commands for the torus to change color/spin but Professor Abram was able to clarify. 
I am little nervous about how I’m going to approach the clock project. 
This week I learned how to add images to p5js and make them do different things like rotate. 
This week I also learned how to add text. 
I learned you have to give the commands to the object first then list the object to appear in the frame.
My goal for next week is to attend office hours so I can ask questions about first project that is due, which for me will be the clock project.
