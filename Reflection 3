This week we learned how to make balloons appear with code and how to make them move. 
I continued to work on my wall drawing which I still am having a bit trouble with. 
It feels frustrating at times to not get something right away but I have been asking questions.
I am working on my clock and projection projects but my confidence in my wall drawing assignment makes me feel like I will need much more assistance.
For my clock project, I am having trouble creating the exact shape I want for the petals to my rose.
I found an easy way to make it half circle but of course I like a challenge and want it to be more intricate. 
I think I need to use baseGeometry or bezierDetail, I will ask about this upcoming class.
For my projection assignment, I want to make it a powerful message surronding ICE and immigration.
